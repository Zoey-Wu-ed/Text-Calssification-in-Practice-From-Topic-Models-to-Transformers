# Text Classification in Practice: From Topic Models to Transformers

Welcome to the Readme file for the CDCS Course '**Text Classification in Practice: From Topic Models to Transformers**'. Below you can find all the details that you will need to get ready and attend this class.

## Overview

Text classification is a core task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), underpinning many real-world applications such as spam filtering, sentiment analysis, and risk prediction.  

This course introduces participants to multiple paradigms of text classification, from traditional topic models to advanced transformer-based approaches. The 4-hour course will be delivered in two 2-hour sessions, combining lectures and hands-on implementation with real-world cases. Participants will build and evaluate classification pipelines with Python using Google Colab, explore feature-based models, sequential modelling, and deep learning with transformers. 

This course is ideal for those seeking to deepen their understanding of NLP workflows and apply them in research or applied contexts. 

## Level   
This is an intermediate to advanced course. Participants should be familiar with Python and Google Colab platform and have working knowledge of common data science libraries, including scikit-learn, pandas, and PyTorch. A conceptual understanding of the machine learning model training, evaluation, and testing process is required. 

## Learning Outcomes  
- Can compare and apply different paradigms of text classification, including feature-based, sequential, and transformer models. 
- Construct and evaluate text classification pipelines using Python.
- Apply text modelling techniques to research or domain-specific applications. 

## Skills   
By attending this course, you will familiarise yourself with the following skills  
- Implementing end-to-end classification workflows with scikit-learn, PyTorch, and Hugging Face Transformers.
- Applying modelling strategies such as topic modelling, RNN-based sequence learning, and fine-tuning pre-trained transformer models.
- Manage and preprocess textual data efficiently using pandas and related libraries.
